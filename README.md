# kitti-detection

This repository contains a vehicle detection pipeline as part of my Capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The aim of the project is to create a model which accurately detects cars at real-time speeds. 

The dataset used for training and testing is from [The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php)

You can download the image data [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_image_2.zip) and the labels [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_label_2.zip)
